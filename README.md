Cryptography Project
SPLIT MESSAGE

This repository contains a cryptography project that I developed as part of my studies. 
The project is implemented in Python and provides a set of tools for encrypting and decrypting messages using cryptographic algorithm.
This tool allows you to split a secret message into codes and then combine those codes to recover the original secret message.
